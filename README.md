# X Tolerator
This [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script does the following things:

1. Gets rid of the "For You" tab functionality and renames it to "Nah, dog".
2. Gets rid of the "Trending Now" section and replaces it with "Trending Mrow".
3. Rids your feed of ads.
4. Gets rid of the "Subscribe to Premium" aside in the sidebar.

This script will surely break at some point, but I'll sporadically keep it updated so long as I personally use X on the desktop!
